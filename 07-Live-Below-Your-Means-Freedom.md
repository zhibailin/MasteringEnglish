> People busy upgrading their lifestyles just can’t [[fathom]] this freedom

> People living below their [[means]] have freedom

Nivi: __Any other__ big things you should avoid, other than renting out your time?

Naval: Yeah, there are two tweets that I put out that are related. 
The first one I was talking about where someone, like, how your lifestyle has to upgrade, shouldn’t get upgraded too fast. 
And that one basically said, people who are __living far below their means__ enjoy a freedom
that people busy upgrading their lifestyles just can’t fathom.

And I think that’s very important, just to not upgrade your lifestyle all the time. __To maintain your freedom__. 
And it just gives you freedom of operation. 
Once you make a little bit of money, you still want to be living like your [[old]] self, so that just the worry goes away. 
So, don’t [[run out]] to upgrade that house, and lifestyle, and all that stuff.

> The most dangerous things are heroin and a monthly salary

~~Let’s say you’re getting paid \$1,000 an hour. The problem is that when you [[go into]] a work lifestyle like that, you don’t just suddenly go from making \$20 an hour to making \$1,000 an hour.That’s a [[progression]] over a long career.
And as that happens, one [[subtle]] problem is
that you upgrade your lifestyle as you make more and more money. And that upgrading of the lifestyle ups __what you consider to be wealth__, and you stay in this [[wage]] slave [[trap]].~~

So, __I forget who said it, maybe it was__ *Nassim Taleb*. But he said, “The most dangerous things are heroin, and a monthly salary.” Right, because they are highly [[addictive]]. 
__The way you want to get wealthy is__ you want to be poor, and working, and working, and working.
