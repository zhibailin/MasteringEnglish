> People busy upgrading their lifestyles just can’t [[fathom]] this freedom

> People living below their [[means]] have freedom

Nivi: __Any other__ big things you should avoid, other than renting out your time?

Naval: Yeah, there are two tweets that I put out that are related. 
The first one I was talking about where someone, like, how your lifestyle has to upgrade, shouldn’t get upgraded too fast. 
And that one basically said, people who are __living far below their means__ enjoy a freedom
that people busy upgrading their lifestyles just can’t fathom.

And I think that’s very important, just to not upgrade your lifestyle all the time. __To maintain your freedom__. 
And it just gives you freedom of operation. 
Once you make a little bit of money, you still want to be living like your [[old]] self, so that just the worry goes away. 
So, don’t [[run out]] to upgrade that house, and lifestyle, and all that stuff.

> The most dangerous things are heroin and a monthly salary

~~Let’s say you’re getting paid \$1,000 an hour. The problem is that when you [[go into]] a work lifestyle like that, you don’t just suddenly go from making \$20 an hour to making \$1,000 an hour.That’s a [[progression]] over a long career.
And as that happens, one [[subtle]] problem is
that you upgrade your lifestyle as you make more and more money. And that upgrading of the lifestyle ups __what you consider to be wealth__, and you stay in this [[wage]] slave [[trap]].~~

So, __I forget who said it, maybe it was__ *Nassim Taleb*. But he said, “The most dangerous things are heroin, and a monthly salary.” Right, because they are highly [[addictive]]. 
__The way you want to get wealthy is__ you want to be poor, and working, and working, and working.

> Ideally, you’ll make your money in [[discrete]] [[lump]]s

And this is ~~for example~~ __how the tech industry works__. Where you don’t make any money for ten years, and then suddenly at year eleven, you might have a giant payday.

Which is, by the way, one reason why these very high [[marginal tax rates]] for the so-called [[wealthy]] are [[flawed]].
Because the highest risk-taking, most creative [[profession]]s you [[literally]] lose money for a decade over your life, while you take massive risk, and you bleed, and bleed, and bleed. And then suddenly in year eleven, or year fifteen, you might have one single big payday. 
But then of course [[Uncle Sam]] [[show up]] and say, “Hey, you know what, you just made a lot money this year. Therefore, you’re rich. Therefore, you’re evil and you’ve got to hand it all over to us.” 
So, it just destroys those [[kind]]s of creative risk-taking [[profession]]s.

But [[ideally]] you want to make your money in discrete lumps, separated over long periods of time, so that your own lifestyle does not have a chance to adapt quickly, and then you can say, “Okay, now I’m done. Now I’m retired. Now I’m free. I’m still gonna work because you got to do something with your life, but I’m gonna work on only the things that I want, when I want.” And so __you have much more creative expression, and much less (expression) about money__.
