> People busy upgrading their lifestyles just can’t [[fathom]] this freedom

> People living below their [[means]] have freedom

Nivi: __Any other__ big things you should avoid, other than renting out your time?

Naval: Yeah, there are two tweets that I put out that are related. 
The first one I was talking about where someone, like, how your lifestyle has to upgrade, shouldn’t get upgraded too fast. 
And that one basically said, people who are __living far below their means__ enjoy a freedom
that people busy upgrading their lifestyles just can’t fathom.

And I think that’s very important, just to not upgrade your lifestyle all the time. __To maintain your freedom__. 
And it just gives you freedom of operation. 
You basically, once you make a little bit of money, you still want to be living like your [[old]] self, so that just the worry goes away. 
So, don’t [[run out]] to upgrade that house, and lifestyle, and all that stuff.
