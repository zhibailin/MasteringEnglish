Next you __go into__ more specific details __on__
how you can actually get rich, and __how you can’t__ get rich.

And __it’s probably not going to__ work. 
__There are many reasons for that__.

But __the most basic is just that__

In almost any __salaried job__, [[even]] __at one__ that’s paying a lot per hour like a lawyer, or a doctor, you’re still __putting in__ the hours, and every hour you get paid.
