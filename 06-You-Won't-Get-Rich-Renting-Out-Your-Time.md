> You can’t earn non-linearly when you’re renting out your time

Nivi: 
Next you __go into__ more specific details __on__
how you can actually get rich, and __how you can’t__ get rich. 
__The first point was__ about __how you’re not going to__ get rich: 
“You are not going to get rich renting out your time. 
You must [[own]] [[equity]], __a piece of the business__ to gain your __financial freedom__.”

Naval: 
This is probably one of __the absolute most important__ points. 
People __[[seem]] to think that__ you can create wealth, and make money through work. 
And __it’s probably not going to__ work. 
__There are many reasons for that__.

But __the most basic is just that__
your inputs are very closely [[tie]]d to your outputs. 
In almost any __salaried job__, [[even]] __at one__ that’s paying a lot per hour like a lawyer, or a doctor, you’re still __putting in__ the hours, and every hour you get paid.
So, __what that means is__
when you’re sleeping, you’re not earning. 
When you’re retired, you’re not earning. 
When you’re on vacation, you’re not earning. 
And you can’t earn non-linearly.

__If you look at__ even doctors who get rich, like really rich, it’s because they __open a business__. They open like __a [[private]] practice__. 
And that private practice builds a brand, and that brand attracts people. 
Or they build some kind of __a medical [[device]]__, 
or a [[procedure]], 
or a process with an __[[intellectual]] [[property]]__.

So, essentially you’re working for somebody else, and that person is taking on the risk, and has the [[accountability]], and the __intellectual property__, and the __brand__. 
So, they’re just not gonna pay you enough. They’re gonna pay you the [[bare]] minimum that they have to, to get you to do their job. And that can be a high bare minimum, but it’s still not gonna be true wealth __where__ you’re retired.

> Renting out your time means you’re essentially replaceable

And then finally you’re actually just not even creating that much [[original]] for society. 
Like I said, this tweetstorm __should have been__ called “How to Create __Wealth__.” (__It’s just__ “How to Get Rich” was a more [[catchy]] title.) 
But you’re not creating new things (Wealth) for society. 
You’re just doing things [[over and over]].

And you’re [[essentially]] [[replaceable]] because you’re now doing __a set role__. 
Most set roles can be taught. If they can be taught like in a school, then eventually you’re gonna be competing with someone who’s got more recent knowledge, who’s been taught, and __is coming in to__ replace you.

You’re much more likely to be doing a job that can be eventually replaced by a robot, or by an AI.
And it doesn’t even have to be [[wholesale]] replaced __over night__. 
It can be replaced __a little bit at a time__. 
And that kind of __eats into__ your __wealth creation__, and [[therefore]] your __earning capability__.

So, fundamentally your __inputs are matched to your outputs__. You are replaceable, and you’re not being creative. I just don’t think that, that is a way that you can truly make money.

> You must own [[equity]] to gain your financial freedom

So everybody who really makes money at some point owns a piece of a product, or a business, or some kind of IP. That can be through __stock options__, so you can be working at a tech company. 
That’s a fine way to start.

But usually the real wealth is created by starting your own companies, or by even investors. 
They’re in an investment firm, and they’re buying equity. 
These are much more the routes to wealth. 
__It doesn’t come through__ the hours.

> You want a career where your inputs don’t match your outputs

You really just want a job, or a career, or a profession where your inputs don’t match your outputs. 
__If you look at__ modern society, again this is later in the tweetstorm. 
[[Business]]es that have high creativity and high [[leverage]] tends to be __ones__ where you could do an hour of work, and it can have a huge effect.
Or you can do 1,000 hours of work, and it can have no effect.
