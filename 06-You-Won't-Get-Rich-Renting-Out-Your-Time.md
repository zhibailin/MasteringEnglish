> You can’t earn non-linearly when you’re renting out your time

Nivi: 
Next you __go into__ more specific details __on__
how you can actually get rich, and __how you can’t__ get rich. 
__The first point was__ about __how you’re not going to__ get rich: 
“You are not going to get rich renting out your time. 
You must [[own]] [[equity]], __a piece of the business__ to gain your __financial freedom__.”

Naval: 
This is probably one of __the absolute most important__ points. 
People __[[seem]] to think that__ you can create wealth, and make money through work. 
And __it’s probably not going to__ work. 
__There are many reasons for that__.

But __the most basic is just that__
your inputs are very closely [[tie]]d to your outputs. 
In almost any __salaried job__, [[even]] __at one__ that’s paying a lot per hour like a lawyer, or a doctor, you’re still __putting in__ the hours, and every hour you get paid.
So, __what that means is__
when you’re sleeping, you’re not earning. 
When you’re retired, you’re not earning. 
When you’re on vacation, you’re not earning. 
And you can’t earn non-linearly.

If you __look at__ even doctors who get rich, like really rich, it’s because they __open a business__. They open like __a [[private]] practice__. 
And that private practice builds a brand, and that brand attracts people. 
Or they build some kind of __a medical [[device]]__, 
or a [[procedure]], 
or a process with an __[[intellectual]] [[property]]__.

So, essentially you’re working for somebody else, and that person is taking on the risk, and has the [[accountability]], and the __intellectual property__, and the __brand__. 
So, they’re just not gonna pay you enough. They’re gonna pay you the [[bare]] minimum that they have to, to get you to do their job. And that can be a high bare minimum, but it’s still not gonna be true wealth __where__ you’re retired.

> Renting out your time means you’re essentially replaceable

And then finally you’re actually just not even creating that much [[original]] for society. 
Like I said, this tweetstorm __should have been__ called “How to Create __Wealth__.” (__It’s just__ “How to Get Rich” was a more [[catchy]] title.) 
But you’re not creating new things (Wealth) for society. 
You’re just doing things [[over and over]].
