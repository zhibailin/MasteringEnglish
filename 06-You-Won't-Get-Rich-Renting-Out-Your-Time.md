> You can’t earn non-linearly when you’re renting out your time

Nivi: 
Next you __go into__ more specific details __on__
how you can actually get rich, and __how you can’t__ get rich. 
__The first point was__ about __how you’re not going to__ get rich: 
“You are not going to get rich renting out your time. 
You must [[own]] [[equity]], __a piece of the business__ to gain your __financial freedom__.”

Naval: 
This is probably one of __the absolute most important__ points. 
People __[[seem]] to think that__ you can create wealth, and make money through work. 
And __it’s probably not going to__ work. 
__There are many reasons for that__.

But __the most basic is just that__
your inputs are very closely [[tie]]d to your outputs. 
In almost any __salaried job__, [[even]] __at one__ that’s paying a lot per hour like a lawyer, or a doctor, you’re still __putting in__ the hours, and every hour you get paid.
So, __what that means is__
when you’re sleeping, you’re not earning. 
When you’re retired, you’re not earning. 
When you’re on vacation, you’re not earning. 
And you can’t earn non-linearly.

If you __look at__ even doctors who get rich, like really rich, it’s because they __open a business__. They open like __a [[private]] practice__. 
And that private practice builds a brand, and that brand attracts people. 
Or they build some kind of __a medical [[device]]__, 
or a [[procedure]], 
or a process with an __[[intellectual]] [[property]]__.
