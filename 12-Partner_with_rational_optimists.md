> Don’t partner with pessimists

Nivi: Let’s do this last tweet. You said, “Don’t partner with cynics, and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.”

Naval: Yes. Essentially, to create things, you have to be a rational optimist. __Rational in the sense that__ you have to see the world for what it really is. 
And yet you have to __be optimistic about__ your own capabilities, and your capability to get things done.

We all know people who are consistently pessimistic, who will [[shoot down]] everything. 
Everyone in their life has the helpful critical guy, right? 
He thinks he’s being helpful, but he’s actually being critical, and he’s a [[downer]] on everything.

That person will not only never do anything great in their lives, they’ll prevent other people around them from doing something great. 
They think their job is to shoot holes in things. 
And it’s okay to shoot holes in things as long as you come up with a solution.

__There’s also the classic [[military line]], “Either lead, follow, or get out of the way.”__ 
And __these people want a fourth option__, where they don’t want to lead, they don’t want to follow, but they don’t want to get out of the way. 
They want to tell you why the thing is not going to work.

And all the really successful people I know have a very strong __action bias__. 
They just do things. 
The easiest way to figure out if something is [[viable]] or not is by doing it. 
At least do the first step, and the second step, and the third, and then decide.

So, __if you want to be__ successful in life, creating wealth, or having good relationships, or being fit, or even being happy, 
__you need to__ have an action bias __towards__ getting what you want.

> Partner with rational optimists

And you have to be optimistic about it. __Not irrationally__. You know, there’s nothing worse than someone who is [[foolhardy]] and chasing something that’s not worth it.

That’s why I say rational optimist. But __you have to be rational__. Know all the [[pitfalls]]. Know the [[downsides]], but still __keep your [[chin]] up__.

You’ve got one life on this planet. Why not try to build something big? 
__This is the beauty of Elon Musk__, and why I think he inspires so many people, it’s just because he __takes on__ really, really big [[audacious]] __tasks__. And he provides an example for people to think big.
