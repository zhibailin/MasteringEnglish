> Don’t partner with pessimists

Nivi: Let’s do this last tweet. You said, “Don’t partner with cynics, and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.”

Naval: Yes. Essentially, to create things, you have to be a rational optimist. __Rational in the sense that__ you have to see the world for what it really is. 
And yet you have to __be optimistic about__ your own capabilities, and your capability to get things done.

We all know people who are consistently pessimistic, who will [[shoot down]] everything. 
Everyone in their life has the helpful critical guy, right? 
He thinks he’s being helpful, but he’s actually being critical, and he’s a [[downer]] on everything.

That person will not only never do anything great in their lives, they’ll prevent other people around them from doing something great. 
They think their job is to shoot holes in things. 
And it’s okay to shoot holes in things as long as you come up with a solution.

__There’s also the classic [[military line]], “Either lead, follow, or get out of the way.”__ 
And __these people want a fourth option__, where they don’t want to lead, they don’t want to follow, but they don’t want to get out of the way. 
They want to tell you why the thing is not going to work.

And all the really successful people I know have a very strong __action bias__. 
They just do things. 
The easiest way to figure out if something is [[viable]] or not is by doing it. 
At least do the first step, and the second step, and the third, and then decide.

So, __if you want to be__ successful in life, creating wealth, or having good relationships, or being fit, or even being happy, 
__you need to__ have an action bias __towards__ getting what you want.

> Partner with rational optimists

And you have to be optimistic about it. __Not irrationally__. You know, there’s nothing worse than someone who is [[foolhardy]] and chasing something that’s not worth it.

That’s why I say rational optimist. But __you have to be rational__. Know all the [[pitfalls]]. Know the [[downsides]], but still __keep your [[chin]] up__.

> think big

You’ve got one life on this planet. Why not try to build something big? 
__This is the beauty of Elon Musk__, and why I think he inspires so many people, it’s just because he __takes on__ really, really big [[audacious]] __tasks__. And he provides an example for people to think big.

And it takes a lot of work to build even small things. I don’t think __the corner [[grocery]] store owner__ is working any less hard than Elon Musk, or pouring any less sweat and [[toil]] into it. Maybe even more.

But for whatever reason, education, [[circumstance]], they didn’t get the chance to think as big, so the outcome is not as big. So, it’s just better to think big. 
[[Obviously]], rationally, within your [[means]], stay optimistic.

The [[cynics]] and the pessimists, what they’re really saying, it’s unfortunate, but they’re saying, “I’ve given up. I don’t think I can do anything. And so the world to me just looks like a world where nobody can do anything. And so __why should ~~not~~ you go__ do something because if you fail, then I’m right, which is great. But __if you succeed, then you just make me look bad__.”

> We descended from pessimists

Nivi: Yes, it’s probably better to be an irrational optimist, then it is to be a rational cynic.

Naval: There’s a completely rational [[frame]] on why you should be an optimist. 
Historically, if you [[go back]] 2,000 years, 5,000 years, 10,000 years, two people are [[wandering through a jungle]], they hear a tiger. 
- One’s an optimist, and says, “Oh, __it’s not headed our way.__” 
- The other one says, “I’m a pessimist, __I’m out of here.__” 

And the pessimist runs and survives, and the optimist gets eaten.

So, __we’re [[descended]] from pessimists__. 
We’re [[genetically]] [[hardwired]] to be pessimists. 
But modern society is far, far safer. There are no tigers __wandering around__ the street. 
__It’s very unlikely that__ you will end up in total ruin, although you should avoid total ruin.
__Much more likely that__ the upside is [[unlimited]], and the downside is limited. 

So, __adapting for__ modern society means __overriding your pessimism__, and taking slightly irrationally optimistic bets 
because the upside is unlimited 
if you start the next SpaceX, or Tesla, or Uber, you can make billions of dollars of value for society, and for yourself, and change the world.

And __if you fail, what’s the big deal?__
You lost a few million dollars of investor money, and they’ve got plenty more, and __that’s the bet__ they __take on the chances__ that you will succeed.

__It made sense to__ be pessimistic in the past. 
__It makes sense to__ be optimistic today, especially if you’re educated and living in a First World country. 
Even a Third World country. I actually think the economic opportunities in Third World countries are much larger.

The one thing you have to avoid is __the risk of ruin__. 
- Ruin means __stay out of [[jail]]__. So, don’t do anything that’s [[illegal]]. It’s never worth it [[to wear an orange jumpsuit]]. 
- And __stay out of__ total [[catastrophic loss]]. That could mean that you stay out of things that could be [[physically dangerous]], hurt your body.

You have to watch your health. And stay out of things that can cause you to lose all of your capital, all of your [[savings]]. 
So, __don’t gamble everything on one go__. But take rationally optimistic bets with big upside.

> BOCTAOE

Nivi: 
I think there __’s__ people that will try and [[build up]] your ideas, and [[build on]] your ideas, __no matter how__ far fetched they might seem. 
And then __there are people__ who list all of the obvious exceptions, __no matter how__ obvious they are.

And fortunately in the startup world, I don’t even really __get exposed to__ the people that are giving you 
- the obvious exceptions, 
- and all the reasons it’s not going to work. 

I barely __get exposed to__ that anymore.

Naval: That’s what Twitter is for. 
Scott Adams __got so annoyed by__ this that he came up with a phrase, an [[acronym]], which is __“but of course there are obvious exceptions”__, *BOCTAOE*. 
And he used to [[pin]] that acronym at the end of his articles __for a while__.

But Twitter is [[overrun]] with [[nitpicker]]s.
Whereas exactly __as you were pointing out__, 
__Silicon Valley has learned that__ the upside is so great that you never [[look down on]] the kid who’s wearing a [[hoodie]] and has coffee on his shoes. 
And just looks like a [[slob]] because you don’t know if he’s going to be the next Mark Zuckerberg, or the next Reid Hoffman.

So, you’ve got to __treat everybody with respect__. 
You’ve got to __look up to__ every possibility, and opportunity because the upside is so unlimited, and the downside is so limited in the modern world, especially with __financial assets and instruments__.
