Nivi: Let’s do this last tweet. You said, “Don’t partner with cynics, and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.”

Naval: Yes. Essentially, to create things, you have to be a rational optimist. __Rational in the sense that__ you have to see the world for what it really is. 
And yet you have to __be optimistic about__ your own capabilities, and your capability to get things done.
