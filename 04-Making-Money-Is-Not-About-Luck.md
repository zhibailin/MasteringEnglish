> Become the kind of person who makes money

## Making money isn't about  
**Naval**:
__Obviously__,
__we want to be__ wealthy, and
__we want to__ get there __in this lifetime__ 
__without having to rely on__ luck.

A lot of people __think__ making money is [[about]] luck.
__It's not.__ 
__It's [[about]]__ becoming the [[kind]] of person that makes money.

__I like to think that__
__if__ I lost __all my money__ and if you drop me on a random street in any __English-speaking country__, 
within 5, 10 years I'__d__ be wealthy again.
Because it's __a skill set__ that I've __developed__ and I think anyone can develop.

In 1000 __parallel universes__, you want to be weatlthy in 999 of them. You don't want be wealthy in the 50 of them __where__ you [[got lucky]].
We want to [[factor]] luck out of it.

__There's__ four __kinds of__ luck that we're talking about. This came from a book. Marc Andreessen, __wrote a blog post about__ it.

### 1. Blind luck
The first kind of luck you might say is blind luck.
__Where__ I just [[got lucky]] because something completely out of my control happened. That's fortune, that's fate.

### 2. Luck from hustling
Then there's luck comes through persistence, hard work, [[hustle]] and motion. Which is
when you're running around creating lots of opportunities,
you're generating lots of energy, 
you're doing a lot of things, 
lots of things will __get [[stir]]red up in the dust__.

__It's almost like__ mix**ing** a [[petri dish]] and see**ing** what combines.
Or mixing __a bunch of reagents__ and seeing what [[combine]]s.
You'__re__ generating enough __force__ and hustle and energy __that__ luck will find you.

We, as a group, you could argue, got together because of that. [Nenad] had __[[put up]] these great videos online__, I saw them __on Twitter__. In that sense, he generated his own luck by creating videos until people like me keep finding him.

### 3. Luck from prepration
__A third way is that__
you __become very good at__ [[spot]]ting luck.
__If__ you are vary [[skilled]] in a field, you __will__ [[notice]] when a lucky [[break]] happens in that field.
When other people who aren't [[attuned]] to it won't [[notice]].
So you become sensitive to luck and __that's through__ skill and knowleage and work.

### 4. Luck from your unique character
Then the last kind of luck is the weiredest, hardest kind. But that's what we want to talk about.
Which is where you build a unique character, a unique brand, a unique [[mindset]], __where then luck finds you__.

For example, let's say that you're the __best__ persion in the world __at__ deep sea underwater diving.
