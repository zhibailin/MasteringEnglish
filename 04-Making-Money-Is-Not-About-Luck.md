> Become the kind of person who makes money

## Making money isn't about luck
**Naval**:
__Obviously__,
__we want to be__ wealthy, and
__we want to__ get there __in this lifetime__ 
__without having to rely on__ luck.

A lot of people __think__ making money is [[about]] luck.
__It's not.__ 
__It's [[about]]__ becoming the [[kind]] of person that makes money.

__I like to think that__
__if__ I lost __all my money__ and if you drop me on a random street in any __English-speaking country__, 
within 5, 10 years I'__d__ be wealthy again.
