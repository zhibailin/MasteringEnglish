> Arm yourself with specific knowledge

Nivi: Do you want to talk a little bit about the skills that you need, in particular specific knowledge, [[accountability]], [[leverage]] and [[judgment]]. So, the first tweet in this area is “Arm yourself with specific knowledge accountability and leverage.” And I’ll throw in judgment as well. I don’t think you covered that in that particular tweet.

Naval: If you want to make money you have to get paid at scale. 
- And why you, that’s accountability, 
- at scale, that’s leverage, 
- and just you getting paid __as opposed to__ somebody else getting paid , that’s specific knowledge.

So, specific knowledge __is probably__ the hardest thing to [[get across]] in this whole tweetstorm, and __it’s probably the thing that__ people get the most confused about.

The thing is that __we have this idea that__ everything can be taught, everything can be taught in school. And __it’s not true that__ everything can be taught. 
In fact, the most interesting things cannot be taught. __But everything can be learned.__ 
~~And very often that~~ learning [[either]] comes from __some [[innate]] characteristics in your DNA__, 
- or it could be through your childhood where you learn soft skills which are very, very hard to teach later on in life, 
- or it’s something that is [[band new]] so nobody else knows how to do it [[either]], 
- or it’s true on the __job training__ because __you’re [[pattern]]__ __matching into__ highly complex environments, __building [[judgment]]__ in a specific domain.
