> Arm yourself with specific knowledge

Nivi: Do you want to talk a little bit about the skills that you need, in particular specific knowledge, [[accountability]], [[leverage]] and [[judgment]]. So, the first tweet in this area is “Arm yourself with specific knowledge accountability and leverage.” And I’ll throw in judgment as well. I don’t think you covered that in that particular tweet.

Naval: If you want to make money you have to get paid at scale. 
- And why you, that’s accountability, 
- at scale, that’s leverage, 
- and just you getting paid __as opposed to__ somebody else getting paid , that’s specific knowledge.

So, specific knowledge __is probably__ the hardest thing to [[get across]] in this whole tweetstorm, and __it’s probably the thing that__ people get the most confused about.

The thing is that __we have this idea that__ everything can be taught, everything can be taught in school. And __it’s not true that__ everything can be taught. 
In fact, the most interesting things cannot be taught. __But everything can be learned.__ 
~~And very often that~~ learning [[either]] comes from __some [[innate]] characteristics in your DNA__, 
- or it could be through your childhood where you learn soft skills which are very, very hard to teach later on in life, 
- or it’s something that is [[band new]] so nobody else knows how to do it [[either]], 
- or it’s true on the __job training__ because __you’re [[pattern]]__ __matching into__ highly complex environments, __building [[judgment]]__ in a specific domain.
  - __Classic example is__ investing, but __it could be__ in anything.
    - It could be in judgment, in running a [[fleet]] of trucks, 
    - it could be judgment in weather forecasting.

So, __specific knowledge is the knowledge that you care about.__ 
Especially if you’re [[later in life]], let’s say your [[post]] 20, 21, 22, 
- you almost __don’t get to__ choose which specific knowledge you have. 
- [[Rather]], you __get to__ look at what you have already built by that point in time, and then you can __build on top of it__.

> Specific knowledge can’t be trained

The first thing to notice about specific knowledge is that you can’t be trained for it. 
If you can be trained for it, if you can go to a class and learn specific knowledge, then somebody else can be trained for it too, and then we can [[mass-produce]] and [[mass-train]] people. 
[[Heck]], we can even program computers to do it and eventually we can program robots to [[walk around]] __doing__ it.
