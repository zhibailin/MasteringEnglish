> Arm yourself with specific knowledge

Nivi: Do you want to talk a little bit about the skills that you need, in particular specific knowledge, [[accountability]], [[leverage]] and [[judgment]]. So, the first tweet in this area is “Arm yourself with specific knowledge accountability and leverage.” And I’ll throw in judgment as well. I don’t think you covered that in that particular tweet.

Naval: If you want to make money you have to get paid at scale. 
- And why you, that’s accountability, 
- at scale, that’s leverage, 
- and just you getting paid __as opposed to__ somebody else getting paid , that’s specific knowledge.

So, specific knowledge __is probably__ the hardest thing to [[get across]] in this whole tweetstorm, and __it’s probably the thing that__ people get the most confused about.

The thing is that __we have this idea that__ everything can be taught, everything can be taught in school. And __it’s not true that__ everything can be taught. 
In fact, the most interesting things cannot be taught. __But everything can be learned.__ 
~~And very often that~~ learning [[either]] comes from __some [[innate]] characteristics in your DNA__, 
- or it could be through your childhood where you learn soft skills which are very, very hard to teach later on in life, 
- or it’s something that is [[band new]] so nobody else knows how to do it [[either]], 
- or it’s true on the __job training__ because __you’re [[pattern]]__ __matching into__ highly complex environments, __building [[judgment]]__ in a specific domain.
  - __Classic example is__ investing, but __it could be__ in anything.
    - It could be in judgment, in running a [[fleet]] of trucks, 
    - it could be judgment in weather forecasting.

So, __specific knowledge is the knowledge that you care about.__ 
Especially if you’re [[later in life]], let’s say your [[post]] 20, 21, 22, 
- you almost __don’t get to__ choose which specific knowledge you have. 
- [[Rather]], you __get to__ look at what you have already built by that point in time, and then you can __build on top of it__.

> Specific knowledge can’t be trained

The first thing to notice about specific knowledge is that you can’t be trained for it. 
If you can be trained for it, if you can go to a class and learn specific knowledge, then somebody else can be trained for it too, and then we can [[mass-produce]] and [[mass-train]] people. 
[[Heck]], we can even program computers to do it and eventually we can program robots to [[walk around]] __doing__ it.

So, if __that’s the [[case]]__, then __you’re extremely replaceable__
and all we have to pay you is the minimum [[wage]] that we have to pay you to get you to do it when there are lots of other takers who can be trained to do it. 
So really, your returns just [[devolve into]] your cost of training plus the return on investment on that training.

So, you [[really]] want to [[pick up]] specific knowledge, 
you need your [[schooling]], 
you need your training to be able to [[capitalize on]] the best specific knowledge, 
but the part of it ~~that you’re going to get paid for~~ is the specific knowledge.

> Specific knowledge is found by __pursuing your curiosity__

For example, someone who goes and gets a degree in [[psychology]] and then becomes a [[salesperson]]. 
Well if they __were already__ a [[formidable]] salesperson, a high grade salesmanship to begin with, then the psychology degree is leverage, it arms them and they do much better at sales.

But if they were always an [[introvert]] never very good at sales and they’re trying to use psychology to learn sales, they’re just not going to get that great at it.

So, specific knowledge is [[found]] much more by pursuing your __innate talents__, your genuine curiosity, and your [[passion]]. 
It’s not by going to school for [[whatever]] is __the hottest job__, 
it’s not for going into whatever field investors say is the hottest.

Very often specific knowledge __is at__ the edge of knowledge. It’s also stuff that’s just being figured out or is really hard to figure out.
So, __if__ you’re not 100% [[into]] it __somebody else__ who is 100% into it will [[outperform]] you. 
And they won’t just outperform you __by a little bit__, 
they’ll outperform you __by a lot__ 
because now we’re __operating the domain__ of ideas, compound interest really __applies__ and leverage really applies.

So, if you’re operating with __1,000 [[times]] leverage__ and somebody is right __80% of the time__, and somebody else is right 90% of time, the person who’s right 90% of the time will [[literally]] get paid __hundreds of [[times]] more__ [[by the market]] 
because of the leverage 
and because of [[the compounding factors]]
and being correct. 
So, you really want to make sure you’re good at it so that genuine curiosity is very important.

> Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you

So, very often, it’s not something you sit down and then you [[reason]] about, it’s more found by [[observation]]. 
You almost have to __look back on your own life__ and see what you’re actually good at.

For example, I wanted to be a scientist and that is where a lot of my [[moral hierarchy]] comes from. 
I view scientists sort of __at the top of the production chain__ for [[humanity]].
And the group of scientists who have __made real breakthroughs and contributions__ that probably added more to human society, I think, than any single other class of human beings.
__Not to take away anything from art or politics or engineering or business__, 
but without the science we’d still be [[scrambling]] in the [[dirt]], fighting with sticks and trying to __start fires__.

My whole [[value system]] was built [[around]] scientists and I wanted to be a great scientist. 
But __when I actually look back at what I was uniquely good at__ and __what I ended up spending my time doing__, 
__it was more [[around]]__ making money, [[tinker]]ing with technology, and selling people on things, explaining things, talking to people.
- So, I have some sales skills, which is __a form of__ specific knowledge that I have. 
- I have some analytical skills around how to make money. 
- And I have this ability to __[[absorb]] data__, [[obsess]] about it, and break it down and that is a specific skill that I have. 
- __I also just love tinkering with technology.__ 

__And all of this stuff feels like play to me, but it looks like work to others.__
So, there are other people to whom these things would be hard and they say like, 
“Well, how do I get good at being [[pithy]] and selling ideas?” 
Well, if you’re not already good at it or if you’re not really into it, 
__maybe it’s not your thing, focus on the thing that you are really into.__

This is [[ironic]], but the first person to actually point out my real specific knowledge was my mother. 
She did it __as an aside__, talking from the kitchen and she said it __when I was like 15 or 16 years old__. 
I was telling a friend of mine that I want to be an [[astrophysicist]] and she said, “No, you’re going to __go into business.__”
__I was like__, “What, my mom’s telling me I’m going to be in business. I’m going to be an astrophysicist. __Mom doesn’t know she’s talking about.”__
But mom __knew exactly what she was talking about.__

She’d already observed that __every time we walk down the street__, I would [[critique]] the local pizza parlor __on__ 
why they were selling their slices a certain way with certain [[toppings]] 
and why their __process of ordering__ was this way when it should have been that way.
So, she knew that I had more of a business curious mind, 
but then my obsession with science combined to create technology and technology businesses __where I found myself.__
So, very often, your specific knowledge is observ**ed** and often observ**ed** by other people who know you well and [[reveal]]**ed** in situations rather than something that you come up with.

## Specific Knowledge Is Highly Creative or Technical

> Specific knowledge can be taught through [[apprenticeships]]

Naval: __To the extent that__ specific knowledge is taught, it’s on the job. It’s through apprenticeships. 
And that’s why the best businesses, the best careers are the apprenticeship or self-taught careers, because those are things society still has not figured out how to train and automate yet.

The __classic line__ here is that Warren Buffett went to Benjamin Graham when he __got out of school__. 
Benjamin Graham was the author of the *Intelligent Investor* and sort of [[modernized]] or created __value investing__ as a [[discipline]]. 
And Warren Buffett went to Benjamin Graham and offered to work for him for free. 
And Graham said, “Actually, you’re [[overpriced]], free is overpriced.” 
And Graham was absolutely right. 
When it comes to a very valuable apprenticeship like the type that Graham was going to give Buffet, Buffet should have been paying him a lot of money. 
That [[right there]] tells you that those are skills worth having.

> Specific knowledge is often highly creative or technical

Specific knowledge also tends to be technical and creative. 
It’s __on the [[bleeding edge]] of__ technology, on the [[bleeding edge]] of art, on the [[bleeding edge]] of communication.
Even today, for example, there are probably [[meme lords]] out there on the Internet who can create incredible memes that will __spread the idea to millions of people__. 
Or are very [[persuasive]] – Scott Adams __is a good example of this__. He is [[essentially]] becoming one of the most credible people in the world by making accurate predictions through [[persuasive]] arguments and videos.

And that is specific knowledge that he __has built up over the years__ because he __got obsessed with__ [[hypnosis]] when he was young, he learned how to communicate through cartooning, he [[embraced]] Periscope early, so he’s been practicing lots of conversation, he’s read all the books on the topic, he’s employed it in his everyday life. If you look at his girlfriend, she’s this beautiful young Instagram model.

That is an example of someone who has built up a specific knowledge [[over the course of]] his career. It’s highly creative, it has elements of being technical in it, and it’s something that is never going to be automated.

No one’s going to take that away from him, because he’s also [[accountable]] __under one brand as Scott Adams__, and he’s operating with the leverage of media with Periscope and drawing Dilbert cartoons and writing books. 
__He has massive leverage on top of that brand__ and he can build wealth out of it if he wanted to build additional wealth beyond what he already has.

> Specific knowledge is specific to the individual and situation

Nivi: Should we be calling it unique knowledge or does specific knowledge [[somehow]] make more sense for it?

Naval: ~~You know, I came up with this framework when I was really young. We’re talking decades and decades. It’s now probably over 30 years old. So, at the time specific knowledge stuck with me so that is how I think about it.~~
The reason I didn’t try and change it is because __every other term__ that I found for it was [[overloaded]] in a different way. At least specific knowledge isn’t that used. I can kind of [[rebrand]] it.

The problem with unique knowledge is, yeah, maybe it’s unique but if I learn it from somebody else it’s no longer unique, then we both know it. So, __it’s not so much that__ it is unique, __it’s that__ it is highly specific to the situation, it’s specific to the individual, it’s specific to the problem, and it can only be built as part of a larger obsession, interest, and time spent in that domain.

__It can’t just be__ read straight out of a single book, 
__nor can it be__ taught in a single course, 
__nor can it be__ programmed into a single algorithm.

> You can’t be too [[deliberate]] about [[assembling]] specific knowledge

Nivi: __Speaking of__ Scott Adams, he’s got a blog post on how to build your career by __getting in__~~, say,~~ the top 25 percentile at three or more things. 
And by doing that, you become the only person in the world who can do those three things in the 25th percentile.

So, instead of trying to be the best at one thing, you just try to be very, very good at three or more things. Is that a way of building specific knowledge?

Naval: I actually think __the best way is__ just to **follow your own obsession**.
