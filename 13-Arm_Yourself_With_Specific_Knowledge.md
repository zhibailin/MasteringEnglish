> Arm yourself with specific knowledge

Nivi: Do you want to talk a little bit about the skills that you need, in particular specific knowledge, [[accountability]], [[leverage]] and [[judgment]]. So, the first tweet in this area is “Arm yourself with specific knowledge accountability and leverage.” And I’ll throw in judgment as well. I don’t think you covered that in that particular tweet.

Naval: If you want to make money you have to get paid at scale. 
- And why you, that’s accountability, 
- at scale, that’s leverage, 
- and just you getting paid __as opposed to__ somebody else getting paid , that’s specific knowledge.

So, specific knowledge __is probably__ the hardest thing to [[get across]] in this whole tweetstorm, and __it’s probably the thing that__ people get the most confused about.

The thing is that __we have this idea that__ everything can be taught, everything can be taught in school. And __it’s not true that__ everything can be taught. 
In fact, the most interesting things cannot be taught. __But everything can be learned.__
