# Pick Partners With Intelligence, Energy and Integrity
> You can’t [[compromise on]] any of these three

> Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy and integrity

Naval: [[In terms of]] picking people to work with, pick ones that have high intelligence, high energy, and high [[integrity]], I find that’s the __three-part checklist__ that you cannot compromise on.

- You need someone who is smart, or they’ll [[head in]] the wrong direction. 
  - And you’re not going to [[end up]] in the right place. 
- You need someone high-energy because __the world is full of smart, lazy people__.

We all know people in our life who are really smart, but can’t get out of bed, or lift a finger. 
And we also know people who are very high energy, but not that smart. So, __they work hard, but they’re sort of running in the wrong direction__.

And smart is not a [[pejorative]]. 
__It’s not meant to say__ someone is smart, someone else is stupid.
__But it’s more that__ everyone is smart at different things. So, depending on what you want to do well, you have to find someone who is smart at that thing.

And then energy, a lot of times people __are [[unmotivated]] for a specific thing__, but they’re motivated for other things. 
So, for example, someone might be really unmotivated to go to a job, and sit in an office. But they might be really motivated to go paint, right?

Well, in that case they should be a painter. They should be putting art up on the internet. Trying to figure out how to build a career [[out of]] that, rather than wearing a [[collar]] around their neck, and going to a [[dreary]] job.

And then high integrity is the most important because otherwise if you’ve got the other two, what you have is you have a smart and hard working [[crook]], who’s eventually going to cheat you. So, you have to figure out if the person is high-integrity.

And as we talked about, the way you do that is through signals. And __signals is what they do, not what they say__. 
It’s all the [[non-verbal stuff]] that they do __when they think nobody is looking__.

> Motivation has to come [[intrinsically]]

Nivi: [[With respect to]] the energy, there was this interesting thing from Sam Altman a while back, __where__ he was talking about [[delegation]], and he was saying, 
“One of the important things for delegation is, [[delegate to]] people who are actually good at the thing that you want them to do.”

It’s the most obvious thing, but it seems like…  you want to __partner with__ people who are [[naturally]] going to do the things that you want them to do.

Naval: Yeah. __I almost won’t__ start a company, or hire a person, or work with somebody __if__ I just don’t think __they’re [[into]]__ what I want them to do.

When I was younger, I used to try and [[talk people into]] things. I had this idea that you could [[sell someone into doing something]]. 
But you can’t. You can’t __keep them motivated__. 
You can get them inspired [[initially]]. 
It might work if you’re a king like Henry V, and you’re trying to get them to just [[charge into]] [[battle]], and then they’ll figure it out.

But if you’re trying to keep someone motivated for the long-term, that motivation has to come [[intrinsically]]. 
You can’t just create it, nor can you be the [[crutch]] for them if they don’t have that intrinsic motivation. 
So, __you have to make sure__ people actually are high-energy, and want to do what you want them to do, and what you want to work with them on.

> Integrity is what someone does, despite what they say they do

Reading signals is very, very important. Signals are what people do [[despite]] what they say. 
So, it’s important to pay attention to [[subtle]] signals. 
We all know that socially if someone treats a waiter, or waitress in a restaurant really badly, then __it’s only a matter of time__ until they treat you badly.

If somebody [[screws]] over an [[enemy]], and is [[vindictive]] towards them, well __it’s only a matter of time__ before they redefine you from friend to enemy, and you feel their [[wrath]]. 
So, angry, [[outraged]], vindictive, short-term thinking people are essentially that way in many interactions in real life.

__People are [[oddly]] consistent.__
That's one of the things you learn about them. So, you want to find long-term people. You want to find people who seem [[irrationally]] ethical.
For example, I had a friend of mine whose company I invested in, and the company failed, and he could have [[wiped out]] all of the investors. But he kept putting more and more personal money in. 
Through three different [[pivots]] he put personal money in until the company finally succeeded. And __in the process, he never wiped out the investors__.
And __I was always grateful to him for that__. 
I said, “Wow, that’s amazing that __you were so good to__ your investors. You didn’t wipe them out.” 
And __he got [[offend]]ed by that.__ 
He said, “I didn’t do it for you. I didn’t do it for my investors. I did it for me. It’s my own [[self-esteem]]. __It’s what I care about.__ That’s how I live my life.” 
That’s the kind of person you want to work with.

Another quote that I like, I have a tweet on this. I think I read this somewhere else, so __I’m not taking credit for this__. But __I kind of modified it a little bit__. Which is that “self-esteem is the reputation that you have with yourself.” You’ll always know.

So, good people, [[moral]] people, ethical people, easy to work with people, reliable people, tend to have very high self-esteem because they have very good reputations with themselves, and they understand that.
