# Pick Partners With Intelligence, Energy and Integrity
> You can’t [[compromise on]] any of these three

> Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy and integrity

Naval: [[In terms of]] picking people to work with, pick ones that have high intelligence, high energy, and high [[integrity]], I find that’s the __three-part checklist__ that you cannot compromise on.

- You need someone who is smart, or they’ll [[head in]] the wrong direction. 
  - And you’re not going to [[end up]] in the right place. 
- You need someone high-energy because __the world is full of smart, lazy people__.

We all know people in our life who are really smart, but can’t get out of bed, or lift a finger. 
And we also know people who are very high energy, but not that smart. So, __they work hard, but they’re sort of running in the wrong direction__.

And smart is not a [[pejorative]]. 
__It’s not meant to say__ someone is smart, someone else is stupid.
__But it’s more that__ everyone is smart at different things. So, depending on what you want to do well, you have to find someone who is smart at that thing.

And then energy, a lot of times people __are [[unmotivated]] for a specific thing__, but they’re motivated for other things. 
So, for example, someone might be really unmotivated to go to a job, and sit in an office. But they might be really motivated to go paint, right?

Well, in that case they should be a painter. They should be putting art up on the internet. Trying to figure out how to build a career [[out of]] that, rather than wearing a [[collar]] around their neck, and going to a [[dreary]] job.

And then high integrity is the most important because otherwise if you’ve got the other two, what you have is you have a smart and hard working [[crook]], who’s eventually going to cheat you. So, you have to figure out if the person is high-integrity.

And as we talked about, the way you do that is through signals. And __signals is what they do, not what they say__. 
It’s all the [[non-verbal stuff]] that they do __when they think nobody is looking__.
