# Pick Partners With Intelligence, Energy and Integrity
> You can’t [[compromise on]] any of these three

> Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy and integrity

Naval: [[In terms of]] picking people to work with, pick ones that have high intelligence, high energy, and high [[integrity]], I find that’s the __three-part checklist__ that you cannot compromise on.

- You need someone who is smart, or they’ll [[head in]] the wrong direction. 
  - And you’re not going to [[end up]] in the right place. 
- You need someone high-energy because __the world is full of smart, lazy people__.

We all know people in our life who are really smart, but can’t get out of bed, or lift a finger. 
And we also know people who are very high energy, but not that smart. So, __they work hard, but they’re sort of running in the wrong direction__.
