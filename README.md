Happy New Year, friends! 2020 was **a tough year** for many. So let's make sure to build, support each other, and lift everyone up in 2021.

# How to Get Rich
Naval's the __co-founder__ of AngelList and Epinions.  
I'm the __co-founder__ of AngelList with Navel.  
I __co-authored__ the Venture Hacks blog with him __back in the day__.  

The "How to Get Rich" tweetstorm __definitely hit a nerve__ and went viral. A lot of people say it was helpful and __reached across aisles__.

People outside of the tech industry--pepole __in all walks of life__--want to known how to solve their money problems.

Wealth __is__ assets that earn while you sleep.
I want the assets that earn while I sleep.

My definition of wealth is __oriented toward__ businesses and assets that can earn while you sleep.

### Wealth buys your freedom
You want wealth because it buys you freedom--  
So you don't have to wear a tie like a collar around your neck;  
so you don't have to wake up at 7:00 a.m. to rush to work and __sit in commute traffic__;  
so you don't have to waste your life grinding productive hours away into a soulless job that doesn't fulfill you.

The purpose of wealth is freedom; It's nothing more than that. It's not to buy fur coats, or to __drive Ferraris__, or to sail yachts, or to __jet around the world__ in a Gulf Stream.
__That stuff__ gets really boring and stupid, really __fast__.
It's about being your own sovereign individual.

It is competitive __to some extent__.
It's __a positive sum game__
--but there are competitive elements to it, because there's __a finite amount of resources__ right now in society.
To get the resources to do what you want, you have to __stand out__.
### Money is how we transfer wealth
Money is how we transfer wealth. Money __is__ social credits.
it's the ability to have credits and __debits__ of other people's time.

If I do my job right and create value for society, society says,"Oh, thank you. We __own you something__ in the future for the work that you did.
Here's a little IOU. Let's call it money.

That money gets __debased__ because people steal the IOUs; the government __prints extra IOUs__;
and people __renege on__ their IOUs;
But money tries to be a reliable IOU from society that you __are owned something for something__ you did in the past.

We transfer these IOUs __around__; money is how we transfer wealth.

### Status is your rank in the social hierarchy.
There are fundamentally two huge games in life that people play. One is the money game.  
Money is not __going to__ solve __all of__ your problems;  
but it's __going to__ solve __all of__ your money problems.
I __think__ people know that. They __realize__ that, __so__ they want to make money.

At the same time, __deep down__ many people believe they can't make it;
so they __don't want__ any wealth creation __to happen__.
The __virtue__ signal by attackting the whole enterprise, saying,"Well, making money is evil. You shouldn't do it."

But they'__re actually__ playing the other game, __which__ is the status game.
They're __trying to be__ high status in the eyes of others by saying,"Well, I don't __need__ money. We don't __want__ money".

Status is your __ranking__ in the social hierarchy.

Wealth is not __a zero-sum game__.

Wealth is a very __positive-sum game__.

Status, __on the other hand__, is a zero-sum game.
It's a very old game. We've been playing it since __monkey tribes__. It's hierarchical.
Who's number one? Who's number two? Who's number three? And __for__ number three __to__ move to number two, number two has to move out of that __slot__. So, status is a zero-sum game.

Politics is __an example of__ **a** status game.
Even sports is __an example of__ a status game. To be the winner, __there must be__ a loser.
Fundamentally, __I don't like__ status games.
__They (status games)__ play __an__ important role in our society, so we can __figure out__ who's in charge.
But you play them(status games) because they're __a__ necessary evil.

__On__ an evolutionary __basis__, if you go back thousands of years -- status is a much better predictor of survival than wealth.
You __couldn't__ have wealth before __the farming age__ because you __couldn't__ store things. Hunter-gatherers carried everything on their back.

### People creating wealth will always be attacked by people playing status games.
There's always a subtle competition __going on__ between status and wealth.
