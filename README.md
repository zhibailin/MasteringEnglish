Happy New Year, friends! 2020 was **a tough year** for many. So let's make sure to build, support each other, and lift everyone up in 2021.

# How to Get Rich
Naval's the __co-founder__ of AngelList and Epinions.  
I'm the __co-founder__ of AngelList with Navel.  
I __co-authored__ the Venture Hacks blog with him __back in the day__.  

The "How to Get Rich" tweetstorm __definitely hit a nerve__ and went viral. A lot of people say it was helpful and __reached across aisles__.

People outside of the tech industry--pepole __in all walks of life__--want to known how to solve their money problems.

Wealth __is__ assets that earn while you sleep.
I want the assets that earn while I sleep.

My definition of wealth is __oriented toward__ businesses and assets that can earn while you sleep.

### Wealth buys your freedom
You want wealth because it buys you freedom--  
So you don't have to wear a tie like a collar around your neck;  
so you don't have to wake up at 7:00 a.m. to rush to work and __sit in commute traffic__;  
so you don't have to waste your life grinding productive hours away into a soulless job that doesn't fulfill you.

The purpose of wealth is freedom; It's nothing more than that. It's not to buy fur coats, or to __drive Ferraris__, or to sail yachts, or to __jet around the world__ in a Gulf Stream.
__That stuff__ gets really boring and stupid, really __fast__.
It's about being your own sovereign individual.

It is competitive __to some extent__.
It's __a positive sum game__
--but there are competitive elements to it, because there's __a finite amount of resources__ right now in society.
To get the resources to do what you want, you have to __stand out__.
### Money is how we transfer wealth
Money is how we transfer wealth. Money __is__ social credits.
it's the ability to have credits and __debits__ of other people's time.

If I do my job right and create value for society, society says,"Oh, thank you. We __own you something__ in the future for the work that you did.
