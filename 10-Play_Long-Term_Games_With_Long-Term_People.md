> All returns in life come from [[compound interest]] in long-term games

> Play long-term games with long-term people

Nivi: 
Talk a little bit about what industries you should think about working in. 
What kind of job you should have? 
And who you might want to work with? 
So, you said, “One should __pick an [[industry]]__ where you can play long-term games with long-term people.”
Why?

Naval: Yeah, this is an [[insight]] into what makes [[Silicon Valley]] work, and what makes [[high trust societies]] work. 
Essentially, all the benefits in life come from compound interests. [[Whether]] it’s in relationships, or making money, or in learning.

So, compound interest is a [[marvelous]] force, where if you [[start out]] with 1x what you have, and then if you increase 20% a year for 30 years, 
__it’s not that__ you got 30 years times 20% added on. 
__It was compounding__, so it just grew, and grew, and grew until you suddenly got __a massive amount of whatever it is__. 
[[Whether]] it’s [[goodwill]], or love, or relationships, or money. So, I think compound interest is a very important force.

You have to be able to play a long-term game. And long-term games are good not just for compound interest, they’re also good for trust. 

If you look at [[prisoner’s dilemma type games]], __a solution to__ prisoner’s dilemma is [[tit for tat]], which is 
I’m just going do to you what you did last time to me with some forgiveness in case there was a mistake made. But that only works in an iterated prisoner’s dilemma, in another words if we play a game [[multiple times]].

So, if you’re __in a situation__, like for example you’re in [[Silicon Valley]], where people are doing business with each other, and they know each other, they trust each other. Then they do right by each other because they know __this person will be around for the next game__.
