> All returns in life come from [[compound interest]] in long-term games

> Play long-term games with long-term people

Nivi: 
Talk a little bit about what industries you should think about working in. 
What kind of job you should have? 
And who you might want to work with? 
So, you said, “One should __pick an [[industry]]__ where you can play long-term games with long-term people.”
Why?

Naval: Yeah, this is an [[insight]] into what makes [[Silicon Valley]] work, and what makes [[high trust societies]] work. 
Essentially, all the benefits in life come from compound interests. [[Whether]] it’s in relationships, or making money, or in learning.

So, compound interest is a [[marvelous]] force, where if you [[start out]] with 1x what you have, and then if you increase 20% a year for 30 years, 
__it’s not that__ you got 30 years times 20% added on. 
__It was compounding__, so it just grew, and grew, and grew until you suddenly got __a massive amount of whatever it is__. 
[[Whether]] it’s [[goodwill]], or love, or relationships, or money. So, I think compound interest is a very important force.

You have to be able to play a long-term game. And long-term games are good not just for compound interest, they’re also good for trust. 

If you look at [[prisoner’s dilemma type games]], __a solution to__ prisoner’s dilemma is [[tit for tat]], which is 
I’m just going do to you what you did last time to me with some forgiveness in case there was a mistake made. But that only works in an iterated prisoner’s dilemma, in another words if we play a game [[multiple times]].

So, if you’re __in a situation__, like for example you’re in [[Silicon Valley]], where people are doing business with each other, and they know each other, they trust each other. Then they do right by each other because they know __this person will be around for the next game__.

Now of course __that doesn’t always work__ because you can make so much money in one [[move]] in Silicon Valley, 
sometimes people [[betray]] each other because they’re just like, “I’m going to get rich enough off this that I don’t care.” 
So, there can be exceptions to all these [[circumstance]]s.

But essentially __if you want to__ be successful, __you have to__ work with other people.
And __you have to figure out who can you trust__, 
and __who can you trust over a long, long period of time, that you can just keep playing the game with them, 
so that compound interest and high trust will __make it easier to__ play the game, 
and will let you collect the major rewards, which are usually at the end of the cycle.

So, for example, [[Warren Buffett]] has done really well as an investor in the U.S. stock market, but the biggest reason he could do that was because the U.S. stock market has been [[stable]], and [[around]], and didn’t get ~~for example~~ [[seized]] by the government during [[a bad administration]]. 
Or the U.S. didn’t [[plunge into some war]]. [[The underlying platform]] didn’t get destroyed. So, in his case, he was playing a long-term game. And the trust came from the U.S. stock market’s [[stability]].

> When you switch industries, you’re starting over from scratch

In Silicon Valley, __the trust comes from__ the network of people in the small [[geographic area]], that __you figure out [[over time]] who you can work with, and who you can’t__.

__If you keep switching locations, you keep switching groups…__ let’s say you [[started out]] in the [[woodworking industry]], and you [[built up a network]] there. 
And you’re working hard, you’re trying to build a product in the woodworking industry. 
And then suddenly another industry comes along that’s [[adjacent]] but different, but you don’t really know anybody in it, and you want to dive in, and make money there.

If you keep [[hop]]ping from industry to … “No, actually I need to open a [[line]] of [[electric car]] stations for electric car [[refuel]]ing.” 
__That might make sense__. That might be the best opportunity. 
But every time you reset, every time you [[wander]] out of where you built your network, you’re going to be __starting from scratch__. You’re not going to know who to trust. They’re not going to know to trust you.

__There are also__ industries in which people are [[transient]] [[by definition]]. They’re always __coming in and going out__. 
[[Politics]] __is an example__ of that, right? In politics new people are being [[elected]]. You see in politics that when you have a lot of [[old-timers]], like the [[Senate]], people who have been [[around]] for a long time, and they’ve been [[career politicians]].

There’s a lot of [[downside]] to career politicians like [[corruption]]. But an [[upside]] is they actually __get [[deal]]s done__ with each other because they know the other person is going to be in the same position ten years from now, 
and they’re going to have to __keep dealing with__ them, 
so they might as well learn how to [[cooperate]].

Whereas every time you get a new incoming [[freshman]] class in [[the House of Representatives]], which [[turns over]] every two years with [[a big wave election]]. 
__Nothing gets done__ because of a lot fighting. “Because I just got here, I don’t know you, I don’t know if you’re going to be around, __why should I work with you rather than just try to do whatever I think is right?__”

So, it’s important to pick an industry where you can play long-term games, and with long-term people. So, those people have to __signal that__ they’re going to __be around for a long time__. That they’re [[ethical]]. 
And their __[[ethics]] are visible through__ their actions.

> Long-term players make each other rich

Nivi: 
- In a long-term game, it seems that everybody is __making each other rich__. 
- And in a short-term game, it seems like everybody is __making themselves rich__.

Naval: I think that is a [[brilliant]] [[formulation]]. 
- In a longterm game, it’s positive sum. __We’re all baking the pie together__. We’re trying to make it as big as possible. 
- And in a short term game, we’re __cutting up the pie__.

Now this is not to [[excuse]] the [[socialists]], right? The socialists are the people who are not [[involved]] in baking the pie, who show up at the end, and say, “I want a slice, or I want the whole pie.” They show up with the guns.

But I think a good leader doesn’t take credit. A good leader basically tries to inspire people, so the team gets the job done. And then things get divided up according to [[fairness]], and who contributed how much, or as close to it as possible, and took a risk, __as opposed to__ just whoever has the longest knife… the sharpest knife at the end.

> Returns come from compound interest in [[iterated games]]

Nivi: So, these next two tweets are, “Play iterated games. All returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge __come from__ compound interest.”

Naval: When you have been doing business with somebody, __you’ve been friends with somebody for ten years__, twenty years, thirty years, it just gets better and better because you trust them so easily. __The [[friction]] goes down__, __you can__ do bigger, and bigger things together.

__For example, the simplest one__ is getting married to someone, and having kids, and [[raising children]]. That’s compound interest, right? Investing in those relationships. 
Those relationships [[end up]] being [[invaluable]] compared to more casual relationships.

__It’s true in__ health and fitness. 
You know, the fitter you are, the easier it is to stay fit. 
Whereas the more you [[deteriorate]] your body, the harder it is to come back, and __[[claw]] your way back__ to a baseline. It requires [[heroic acts]].

Nivi: [[Regarding]] compound interest, I think I saw [[retweet]] something [[a while back]].
~~Maybe it was from Ed Latimore.~~ [[It went]] something [[along the lines]] of, 
“Get some [[traction]]. Get [[purchase]], and don’t lose it”. 
So, the idea was to gain some [[initial traction]], and never [[fall back]], just [[keep ratcheting up]], and up.

Naval: __I don’t remember it exactly.__ But I think that was right. Yes, it was like, “Get traction, and don’t let go.” It was a good one, yes.
