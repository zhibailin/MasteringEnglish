Nivi: Let’s look at this next tweet, which I thought was [[cryptic]], and also super interesting, about the kind of job or career that you might have. 
You said, “The internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. __Most people haven’t figured this out yet__.”

Naval: The fundamental property of the internet more than any other single thing is it connects every human to each other human on the planet. You can now reach everyone.

Whether it’s by emailing them personally, whether it’s by broadcasting to them on Twitter, whether it’s by posting something on Facebook that they find, whether it’s by putting up a website they come and access.

__It connects everyone to everyone__. So, the internet is an inter-networking tool. __It connects everybody__. That is its superpower. So, you want to use that.

What that helps you figure out is the internet means you can find your audience for your product, or your talent, and skill 
__no matter how far away they are__.
