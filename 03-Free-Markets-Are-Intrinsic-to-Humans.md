## Free markets are intrinsic to the human species.

Naval:
Overall capitalism (meaning free markets) is intrinsic to the human species.
Capitalism __is not something__ we invented.
Capitalism __is not even somehting__ we discovered.
It is in us in every exchange that we have.

When __you and I__ exchange information, __I want some information back from you__.
I give you information. You give me information.
__If__ we __weren't__ having a good information exchange, you'__d__ go talk to somebody else.
So, __the notion of__ exchange, and __keeping track of__ credits and debits, this is built into us as flexible social animals.

We are the only animals in the animal kingdom that cooperate across genetic boundaries. Most animals __don't [[even]]__ cooperate.
But when they do, they cooperate only in [[pack]]s where they co-evolve together,
and they shere blood, so they have some __shared interests__.

Humans __don't have__ that.
I can cooperate with [[you guys]].
One of you is a Serbian. The other one is __a__ Persian [[by origin]]. And I'm Indian __by origin__.
We have very little blood in common, __basically none__. But we still [[cooperate]].

What let**s** us cooperate?
__It's because__ we can keep track of debits and credits.
Who [[put in]] how much work?
Who contributed how much?
__That's all__ free market capitalism __is__.
