> We use credits and debits to cooperate across genetic boundaries.

## Free markets are intrinsic to the human species.

Naval:
Overall capitalism (meaning free markets) is intrinsic to the human species.
Capitalism __is not something__ we invented.
Capitalism __is not even somehting__ we discovered.
It is in us in every exchange that we have.

When __you and I__ exchange information, __I want some information back from you__.
I give you information. You give me information.
__If__ we __weren't__ having a good information exchange, you'__d__ go talk to somebody else.
So, __the notion of__ exchange, and __keeping track of__ credits and debits, this is built into us as flexible social animals.

We are the only animals in the animal kingdom that cooperate across genetic boundaries. Most animals __don't [[even]]__ cooperate.
But when they do, they cooperate only in [[pack]]s where they co-evolve together,
and they shere blood, so they have some __shared interests__.

Humans __don't have__ that.
I can cooperate with [[you guys]].
One of you is a Serbian. The other one is __a__ Persian [[by origin]]. And I'm Indian __by origin__.
We have very little blood in common, __basically none__. But we still [[cooperate]].

What let**s** us cooperate?
__It's because__ we can keep track of debits and credits.
Who [[put in]] how much work?
Who contributed how much?
__That's all__ free market capitalism __is__.

So __I strongly believe that__
__it is innate to__ the human species,
and __we are going to__ create more and more wealth, and abundance for everybody.

Everybody can be wealthy.
Everybody can be retired.
Everybody can be successfull.
__It is merely a question of__ education and desire.
You have to want it. __If you don't__ want it, __that's fine__. __Then__ you opt out of the game.

But don't try to [[put down]] the people who are playing the game.
Because  
that's the game that [[keep#^90bfe8|keep]]s you __in__ a comfortable warm bed at night.  
That's the game that [[keep#^148e53|keep]]s [[a roof over your head]].  
That's the game that [[keep#^1229d9|keep]]s your supermarkets stocked.  
That's the game that [[keep#^1229d9|keep]]s your iPhone buzzing in your pocket.

So, it is a beautiful game that __is worth__ play**ing** ethically, rationally, morally, socially for the human race.
[[It's going to continue to]] make us all richer and richer, __until__ we have massive wealth creation for anybody who wants it.

## Too many takers and not enough makers will plunge a society into ruin

Nivi: [[It's not just]] individuals
__secretly__ despising wealth, right? __There are__ countries, groups, political parties that __overtly__ despise wealth.
Or [[at least seem to]].

Naval:
That's right.
What those countries, political parties, and groups are [[reduce]]d to
is playing the zero-sum game of status.
[[In the process#^596b99|in the process]] 
to destroy wealth creation, __they drag everybody down to their level__.

Which is why the U.S. is a very popular country for immigrants because of the American dream.
__Anyone can__ come here, __be__ poor, __and then__ work really hard __and__ make money, __and__ get wealthy.
[[but#^76cd47|But]] even just make some basic money for their life.

Obviously, __the definition of__ wealth __is different for different people__.
A First World citizen's definition of wealth __might be__, "Oh, I have to __make millions of dollars__, and __I'm completely [[done]]__."

Whereas to a Third World poor immigrant just entering the country, and we were poor immigrants who came here when I was fairly young, to the United States, wealth may just be a much lower number.
__It may just be__, "I don't have to work a manual labor job for the rest of my life that I don't want to work."

But groups that [[despise]] it will essentially bring the entire group to that level.
If you get too many takers, and not enough makers, society [[fall apart|falls apart]].
You [[end up with]] a communist country.
__Look at__ the Venezuela, right?

They were so [[busy]] tak**ing**, and divid**ing**, and reallocat**ing**,
that people are [[literally]] starving in the streets, and __losing kilograms of body weight__ every year __from sheer starvation__.

__Another way to think about it is__ imagine an __organism__ that has too many [[parasites]].
You __need__ some small number of [[parasites]] __to__ stay healthy.

You need a lot of symbiotes. All the mitochondria in all our cells that help us respirate and burn oxygen. __These are__ symbiotes __that__ help us survive. 
__We couldn't__ survive __without__ them.

But, __to me__, those are partners in the wealth creation that creates the human body.

But 
__if__ you __just were__ filled with parasites,
__if__ you __got infected with__ worms, or a virus, or bacteria
that were __purely parasitical__, you __would__ die.
