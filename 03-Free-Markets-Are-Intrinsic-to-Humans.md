## Free markets are intrinsic to the human species.

Naval:
Overall capitalism (meaning free markets) is intrinsic to the human species.
Capitalism __is not something__ we invented.
Capitalism __is not even somehting__ we discovered.
It is in us in every exchange that we have.

When __you and I__ exchange information, __I want some information back from you__.
I give you information. You give me information.
__If__ we __weren't__ having a good information exchange, you'__d__ go talk to somebody else.
So, __the notion of__ exchange, and __keeping track of__ credits and debits, this is built into us as flexible social animals.

We are the only animals in the animal kingdom that cooperate across genetic boundaries. Most animals __don't [[even]]__ cooperate.
But when they do, they cooperate only in [[pack]]s where they co-evolve together,
and they shere blood, so they have some __shared interests__.

Humans __don't have__ that.
I can cooperate with [[you guys]].
One of you is a Serbian. The other one is __a__ Persian [[by origin]]. And I'm Indian __by origin__.
We have very little blood in common, __basically none__. But we still [[cooperate]].

What let**s** us cooperate?
__It's because__ we can keep track of debits and credits.
Who [[put in]] how much work?
Who contributed how much?
__That's all__ free market capitalism __is__.

So __I strongly believe that__
__it is innate to__ the human species,
and __we are going to__ create more and more wealth, and abundance for everybody.

Everybody can be wealthy.
Everybody can be retired.
Everybody can be successfull.
__It is merely a question of__ education and desire.
You have to want it. __If you don't__ want it, __that's fine__. __Then__ you opt out of the game.

But don't try to [[put down]] the people who are playing the game.
Because  
that's the game that [[keep#^90bfe8|keep]]s you __in__ a comfortable warm bed at night.  
That's the game that [[keep#^148e53|keep]]s [[a roof over your head]].  
That's the game that [[keep#^1229d9|keep]]s your supermarkets stocked.  
That's the game that [[keep#^1229d9|keep]]s your iPhone buzzing in your pocket.

So, it is a beautiful game that __is worth__ play**ing** ethically, rationally, morally, socially for the human race.
[[It's going to continue to]] make us all richer and richer, __until__ we have massive wealth creation for anybody who wants it.
