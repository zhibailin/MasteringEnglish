> Build your character in a way that luck becomes deterministic.

Nivi: I think it’s pretty interesting that the first three kinds of luck that you described
__there are very common [[cliche]]s for__ them that everybody knows. 
And then for that last kind of luck that __comes to you__
out of the unique way that you act,
__there’s no real cliche for__ it.

So, for the first three kinds, there’s “[[dumb luck]],” or “[[blind]] luck.” That’s the first kind of luck. 

The second kind of luck there’s the cliché that __“fortune favors the [[bold]].”__ That’s a person who gets lucky just by [[stir]]ring the [[pot]] and acting.

The third kind of luck, people say that __“chance favors the prepared mind.”__

But __for the fourth kind of luck__, there isn’t __a common cliché__ [[out]] there
that __matches the unique character__ of your action, 
which I think is interesting 
and __perhaps__ an opportunity 
and __it also shows that__ people aren’t [[necessarily]] taking advantage of that kind of luck 
the way they should be.

Naval: 
__I think [[also]]__
at that point, it starts becoming so deterministic that it stops being luck. 
So, the definition starts [[fade|fading]] from luck to more [[destiny]]. 
So, I would [[characterize]] that fourth one __as__
you build your character in a certain way and then your character becomes your [[destiny]].

## Build your character so opportunity finds you
Character, One of the things I think that is important to making money,when you want the kind of reputation that makes people __do deals__ through you. 
I use the example of like, __if__ you’re a great diver __then__ treasure __hunters will come__ and give you a piece of the treasure for your diving skills.

__If__ you’re a trusted, reliable, high-[[integrity]], long-term thinking deal maker, __then__ when other people want to do deals but they don’t know how to do them in a trustworthy manner with strangers, they __will__ [[literally]] approach you and give you a [[cut]] of the deal or offer you a unique deal just because of the [[integrity]] and reputation that you have built up.

Warren Buffett, he gets __offered__ [[deal]]s,
and he [[get to|gets to]] buy companies, 
and he gets to buy [[warrant]]s, and [[bailout]] banks 
and do things that other people can’t do because of his reputation.

But of course that’s [[fragile]]. 
__It has__ [[accountability]] __on the [[line]]__, 
__it has__ a strong brand __on the line__, and as we will talk about later, 
that comes __with [[accountability]] [[attached]]__.

But I would say
your character, your reputation, 
__these are things that__ you can build 
__then will__ __let you__ take up advantage of opportunities 
__that__ other people may [[characterize]] as lucky but you know that it wasn’t luck.

Nivi: 
You said that this fourth kind of luck __is [[more or less]] a [[destiny]]__. 
There’s a [[quote]] from that original book that was in Marc’s blog posts from Benjamin Disraeli, who I think was the __former [[prime]] [[minister]]__ of the UK. 
The quote ~~to describe this kind of luck~~ was, “we make our [[fortune]]s and we call them fate.”
