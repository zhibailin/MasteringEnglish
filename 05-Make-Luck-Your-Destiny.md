> Build your character in a way that luck becomes deterministic.

Nivi: I think it’s pretty interesting that the first three kinds of luck that you described
__there are very common [[cliche]]s for__ them that everybody knows. 
And then for that last kind of luck that __comes to you__
out of the unique way that you act,
__there’s no real cliche for__ it.

So, for the first three kinds, there’s “[[dumb luck]],” or “[[blind]] luck.” That’s the first kind of luck. 

The second kind of luck there’s the cliché that “fortune favors the [[bold]].” That’s a person who gets lucky just by [[stir]]ring the [[pot]] and acting.

The third kind of luck, people say that __“chance favors the prepared mind.”__

But __for the fourth kind of luck__, there isn’t __a common cliché__ [[out]] there
that __matches the unique character__ of your action, 
which I think is interesting 
and __perhaps__ an opportunity 
and __it also shows that__ people aren’t [[necessarily]] taking advantage of that kind of luck 
the way they should be.
