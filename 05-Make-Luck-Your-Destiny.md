> Build your character in a way that luck becomes deterministic.

Nivi: I think it’s pretty interesting that the first three kinds of luck that you described
__there are very common [[cliche]]s for__ them that everybody knows. 
And then for that last kind of luck that __comes to you__
out of the unique way that you act,
__there’s no real cliche for__ it.

So, for the first three kinds, there’s “[[dumb luck]],” or “[[blind]] luck.” That’s the first kind of luck. 

The second kind of luck there’s the cliché that __“fortune favors the [[bold]].”__ That’s a person who gets lucky just by [[stir]]ring the [[pot]] and acting.

The third kind of luck, people say that __“chance favors the prepared mind.”__

But __for the fourth kind of luck__, there isn’t __a common cliché__ [[out]] there
that __matches the unique character__ of your action, 
which I think is interesting 
and __perhaps__ an opportunity 
and __it also shows that__ people aren’t [[necessarily]] taking advantage of that kind of luck 
the way they should be.

Naval: 
__I think [[also]]__
at that point, it starts becoming so deterministic that it stops being luck. 
So, the definition starts [[fade|fading]] from luck to more [[destiny]]. 
So, I would [[characterize]] that fourth one __as__
you build your character in a certain way and then your character becomes your [[destiny]].

## Build your character so opportunity finds you
Character, One of the things I think that is important to making money,when you want the kind of reputation that makes people __do deals__ through you. 
I use the example of like, __if__ you’re a great diver __then__ treasure __hunters will come__ and give you a piece of the treasure for your diving skills.

__If__ you’re a trusted, reliable, high-[[integrity]], long-term thinking deal maker, __then__ when other people want to do deals but they don’t know how to do them in a trustworthy manner with strangers, they __will__ [[literally]] approach you and give you a [[cut]] of the deal or offer you a unique deal just because of the [[integrity]] and reputation that you have built up.

Warren Buffett, he gets __offered__ [[deal]]s,
and he [[get to|gets to]] buy companies, 
and he gets to buy [[warrant]]s, and [[bailout]] banks 
and do things that other people can’t do because of his reputation.

But of course that’s [[fragile]]. 
__It has__ [[accountability]] __on the [[line]]__, 
__it has__ a strong brand __on the line__, and as we will talk about later, 
that comes __with [[accountability]] [[attached]]__.

But I would say
your character, your reputation, 
__these are things that__ you can build 
__then will__ __let you__ take up advantage of opportunities 
__that__ other people may [[characterize]] as lucky but you know that it wasn’t luck.

Nivi: 
You said that this fourth kind of luck __is [[more or less]] a [[destiny]]__. 
There’s a [[quote]] from that original book that was in Marc’s blog posts from Benjamin Disraeli, who I think was the __former [[prime]] [[minister]]__ of the UK. 
The quote ~~to describe this kind of luck~~ was, “we make our [[fortune]]s and we call them fate.”

## You have to be a little [[eccentric]] to be out on the [[frontier]] by yourself

There were a couple other interesting things about this kind of luck that were mentioned in the blog post, I think it’ll be good for the listeners to hear about is that, this fourth kind of luck __can almost come out of [[eccentric]] ways__ that you do your things 
and that [[eccentricity]] __is not necessarily a bad thing in this case__. In fact, it’s a good thing.

Naval: 
Yeah, absolutely. 
Because the world is a very efficient place, so, everyone has [[dig|dug]]
[[through]] all the obvious places to [[dig]]
[[and so]] to find something that’s new and [[novel]] and [[uncovered]], 
__it helps to be__ operat**ing** on a [[frontier]].

Where __[[right]] there__ you have to be a little [[eccentric]] to be out __on the frontier__ by yourself, and then you have to __be willing to__ dig deeper than other people do, deeper than seems [[rational]] __just because__ you’re interested.

Nivi: 
Yeah, the two [[quote]]s that I’ve seen that express this kind of luck __in addition to__ that Benjamin Disraeli one, are this one from Sam Altman where he said, __“extreme people get extreme results.”__
I think that’s __pretty nice__. 
And then there’s __this other one__ from Jeffrey Pfeffer, who is __a professor at__ Stanford that, __“you can’t be normal and expect [[abnormal]] returns.”__ __I’ve always enjoyed__ that one too.

Naval: 
Yeah. And one quote that I like 
~~which is __the exact [[opposite]] of__ that~~
is, __“play stupid games win stupid prizes.”__
A lot of people spend a lot of their time playing __social games__ like on Twitter where you’re trying to improve your __social [[standing]]__ and you basically win stupid __social prizes__ which are [[worthless]].

Nivi: 
I guess the last thing that I have from this blog post is the idea that 
__by [[pursue|pursuing]]__ these kinds of luck especially the last one, basically __everything but__ dumb luck, 
__by pursuing__ them you [[essentially]] [[run out of]] unluck. 
So, if you __just__ keep [[stir]]ring the pot and stirring the pot, that [[alone]] you will run out of unluck.

Naval: 
Yeah, or it could just __be [[reversion]] to the mean__. 
So, then you at least [[neutralize]]d luck so that __it’s__ your own talents that __come into play__.
