> Build your character in a way that luck becomes deterministic.

Nivi: I think it’s pretty interesting that the first three kinds of luck that you described
__there are very common [[cliche]]s for__ them that everybody knows. 
And then for that last kind of luck that __comes to you__
out of the unique way that you act,
__there’s no real cliche for__ it.

So, for the first three kinds, there’s “[[dumb luck]],” or “[[blind]] luck.” That’s the first kind of luck.
