Naval: Foundational things are principles, they’re algorithms, they’re [[deep-seated]] logical understanding where you can [[defend]] it or attack it from any angle. 
And that’s why [[microeconomics]] is important because __[[macroeconomics]] is a lot of [[memorization]]__, 
a lot of [[macro bullshit]].

As Nassim Taleb says, it is easier to macro bullshit than it is the micro bullshit. 
Because macroeconomics is [[voodoo-complex-science]] meets politics. 
You can’t find two macroeconomists to agree on anything these days, and __different macroeconomists get used by different politicians__ to [[peddle]] their different __pet theories__.

There are even macroeconomists out there now peddling something called _Modern Monetary Theory_ which basically says, hey, except for this pesky thing called [[inflation]], we can just __print all the money__ that we want. 
Yes, except for this pesky thing called inflation. __That’s like saying__, except for limited energy, we can fire rockets off into space [[all day long]].
