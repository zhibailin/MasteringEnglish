## Make Abundance for the World
> Wealth isn't about taking something from somebody else

__Ethical wealth creation__ makes abundance for the world.

I think there is this __notion__ that making money is evil, right?
It'__s rooted__ **all the way** back down to "money is the root of all evil."
__People think that__ the bankers steal our money.
It's __somewhat__ true in that,
__in a lot of the world__, 
there's a lot of **theft** __going on__ **all the time**.

The history of the world, __in some sense__, is **this** predator/prey relationship between makers and takers.
There are people who go out and create things, and build things, and __work__ hard __on__ things.
Then there are people who come along with a sword, or a gun, or taxes, or __crony capitalism__, or Communism, or what have you. There's all these different methods to steal.

Even in nature, there are more __parasites__ than there are __non-parasitical organisms__.
You have a ton of parasites in you, who are __living off__ of you.
__The better ones are__ symbiotic, they're giving something back.
But there are a lot (parasites) that are just taking. __That's the nature of__ how any complex system is built.

__[[What I am focused on]]__ is true wealth creation.
__It's not about__ taking money. 
__It's not about__ taking something from somebody else. 
__It's from__ creating abundance.

Obviously, __there isn't a finite__ jobs, or finite amount of wealth. 
__Otherwise__ we __would__ still be sitting around in caves, figureing out how to divide up pieces of fire wood, and the oocasional dead deel.

Most of the wealth in civilization, in fact all of it, has been created. 
__It got created from__ somewhere. 
__It got created from__ people. 
__It got created from__ technology. 
__It got created from__ productivity. 
__It got created from__ hard work.
This idea that it's stolen is this horrible zero-sum game that people who are trying to gain status play.

But __the reality is__ everyone can be rich.
We __can see that__ by seeing, that in __the First World__, everyone is basically richer than almost anyone who was alive 200 years ago.

200 years ago nobody had __antibiotics__.
Nobody had cars.
Nobody had electricity.
Nobody had the iPhone.
__All of these things__ are inventions that have made us wealthier as a species.

Today, I would rather be a poor persion in __a First World country__, than be a rich person in __Louis the XIV's France__.
I'__d rather__ be a poor person today __than__ aristocrat __back then__.
__That's because of__ wealth creation.

__The engine of__ technology __is__ science
that __is applied for the purpose of__ creating abundance.
