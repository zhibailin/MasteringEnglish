## Make Abundance for the World
> Wealth isn't about taking something from somebody else

__Ethical wealth creation__ makes abundance for the world.

I think there is this __notion__ that making money is evil, right?
It'__s rooted__ **all the way** back down to "money is the root of all evil."
__People think that__ the bankers steal our money.
It's __somewhat__ true in that,
__in a lot of the world__, 
there's a lot of **theft** __going on__ **all the time**.

The history of the world, __in some sense__, is **this** predator/prey relationship between makers and takers.
There are people who go out and create things, and build things, and __work__ hard __on__ things.
Then there are people who come along with a sword, or a gun, or taxes, or __crony capitalism__, or Communism, or what have you. There's all these different methods to steal.

Even in nature, there are more __parasites__ than there are __non-parasitical organisms__.
You have a ton of parasites in you, who are __living off__ of you.
