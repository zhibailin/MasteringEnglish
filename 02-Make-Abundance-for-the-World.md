## Make Abundance for the World
> Wealth isn't about taking something from somebody else

__Ethical wealth creation__ makes abundance for the world.

I think there is this __notion__ that making money is evil, right?
It'__s rooted__ **all the way** back down to "money is the root of all evil."
__People think that__ the bankers steal our money.
It's __somewhat__ true in that,
__in a lot of the world__, 
there's a lot of **theft** __going on__ **all the time**.
