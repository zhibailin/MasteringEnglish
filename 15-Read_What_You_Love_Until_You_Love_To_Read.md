> Read what you love until you love to read

Nivi: Before we go and talk about accountability and leverage and judgment, you’ve got a few tweets further down-the-line that I would put in the category of __continuous learning__.

They’re essentially, “there is no skill called business. Avoid business magazines and business class, study microeconomics, game theory, [[psychology]], [[persuasion]], ethics, mathematics and computers.”

__There’s one other comment that__ you made in a Periscope that was, “you should be able to pick up any book in the library and read it.” And the last tweet in this category was, “reading is faster than listening, doing is faster than watching.”

Naval: Yeah, the most important tweet on this, ~~I don’t even have in here unfortunately,~~ which is, the foundation of learning is reading. I don’t know a smart person who doesn’t read and read all the time.

And __the problem is__, what do I read? How do I read? 
Because for most people __it’s a [[struggle]], it’s a [[chore]]__.
So, the most important thing is just __to learn how to educate yourself and the way to educate yourself is to develop a love for reading__

So, the tweet that [[is left out]], the one that I was [[hinting at]] is, “read what you love until you love to read.” It’s that simple.

Everybody I know who reads a lot loves to read, and they love to read because they read books that they loved. 
__It’s a little bit of a [[catch-22]]__, but you basically want to [[start off]] just reading wherever you are and then keep building up from there until reading becomes a habit. 
And then eventually, you will just __get bored of the simple stuff__.

So you may start off reading fiction, 
then you might [[graduate]] to science fiction, 
then you may graduate to non-fiction, 
then you may graduate to science, or philosophy, or mathematics or whatever it is, 
but __[[take]] your natural path__ and just read the things that interest you until you kind of understand them. 
And then you’ll naturally move to the next thing and the next thing and the next thing.

> Read the original scientific books in a field

Now, __there is an exception to this__, which is where I was hinting with what things you actually do want to learn, which is, at some point there’s too much out there to read. 
Even reading is full of junk.

There are actually things you can read, especially [[early on]], that will program your brain a certain way, 
and then later things that you read, you will decide whether those things are true or false __based on the earlier things__.

So, it is important that you read foundational things. 
And foundational things, I would say, are the original books in a given field that are very scientific in their nature.

For example, 
__instead of__ reading a business book, __pick up__ Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations. 
__Instead of__ reading a book on biology or evolution that’s written today, I __would pick up__ Darwin’s Origin of the Species. 
__Instead of__ reading a book on [[biotech]] right now that may be very advanced, I __would just pick up__ The Eighth Day of Creation by Watson and Crick. 
__Instead of__ reading advanced books on what [[cosmology]] and what Neil Degrasse Tyson and Stephen Hawking have been saying, you __can pick up__ Richard Feynman’s Six Easy Pieces and start with basic physics.

> Don’t fear any book

If you understand the basics, especially in mathematics and physics and sciences, then you will not be afraid of any book. 
All of us have that memory of when we were sitting in class and we’re learning mathematics, and it was all logical and all made sense until at one point the class moved too fast and we fell behind.
Then after that we were left memorizing equations, memorizing concepts without being able to derive them from first principles. 
And at that moment, we’re lost, because unless you’re a professional mathematician, you’re not going to remember those things. 
All you’re going to remember are the techniques, the foundations.

The ultimate is when you walk into a library and you look at it up and down and you don’t fear any book. You know that you can take any book off the shelf, you can read it, you can understand it, you can absorb what is true, you can reject what is false, and you have a basis for even working that out that is logical and scientific and not purely just based on opinions.
