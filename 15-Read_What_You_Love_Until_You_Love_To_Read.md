> Read what you love until you love to read

Nivi: Before we go and talk about accountability and leverage and judgment, you’ve got a few tweets further down-the-line that I would put in the category of __continuous learning__.

They’re essentially, “there is no skill called business. Avoid business magazines and business class, study microeconomics, game theory, [[psychology]], [[persuasion]], ethics, mathematics and computers.”

__There’s one other comment that__ you made in a Periscope that was, “you should be able to pick up any book in the library and read it.” And the last tweet in this category was, “reading is faster than listening, doing is faster than watching.”

Naval: Yeah, the most important tweet on this, ~~I don’t even have in here unfortunately,~~ which is, the foundation of learning is reading. I don’t know a smart person who doesn’t read and read all the time.

And __the problem is__, what do I read? How do I read? 
Because for most people __it’s a [[struggle]], it’s a [[chore]]__.
