> Read what you love until you love to read

Nivi: Before we go and talk about accountability and leverage and judgment, you’ve got a few tweets further down-the-line that I would put in the category of __continuous learning__.

They’re essentially, “there is no skill called business. Avoid business magazines and business class, study microeconomics, game theory, [[psychology]], [[persuasion]], ethics, mathematics and computers.”

__There’s one other comment that__ you made in a Periscope that was, “you should be able to pick up any book in the library and read it.” And the last tweet in this category was, “reading is faster than listening, doing is faster than watching.”

Naval: Yeah, the most important tweet on this, ~~I don’t even have in here unfortunately,~~ which is, the foundation of learning is reading. I don’t know a smart person who doesn’t read and read all the time.

And __the problem is__, what do I read? How do I read? 
Because for most people __it’s a [[struggle]], it’s a [[chore]]__.
So, the most important thing is just __to learn how to educate yourself and the way to educate yourself is to develop a love for reading__

So, the tweet that [[is left out]], the one that I was [[hinting at]] is, “read what you love until you love to read.” It’s that simple.

Everybody I know who reads a lot loves to read, and they love to read because they read books that they loved. 
__It’s a little bit of a [[catch-22]]__, but you basically want to [[start off]] just reading wherever you are and then keep building up from there until reading becomes a habit. 
And then eventually, you will just __get bored of the simple stuff__.

So you may start off reading fiction, 
then you might [[graduate]] to science fiction, 
then you may graduate to non-fiction, 
then you may graduate to science, or philosophy, or mathematics or whatever it is, 
but __[[take]] your natural path__ and just read the things that interest you until you kind of understand them. 
And then you’ll naturally move to the next thing and the next thing and the next thing.

> Read the original scientific books in a field

Now, __there is an exception to this__, which is where I was hinting with what things you actually do want to learn, which is, at some point there’s too much out there to read. 
Even reading is full of junk.
