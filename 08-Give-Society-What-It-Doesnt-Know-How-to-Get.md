# Give Society What It Doesn’t Know How to Get

> Society will pay you for creating what it wants and delivering it at scale

> Give society what it wants, but doesn’t know how to get-at scale

Nivi: You’re not gonna get rich renting out your time. But you say that, “you will get rich by giving society what it wants, but does not yet know how to get [[at scale]].”

Naval: That’s right. So, essentially as we talked about before, money is `IOUs` from society saying, “You did something good in the past. Now here’s something that we owe you for the future.” And so society will __pay you for__ creating things that it wants.

But society doesn’t [[yet]] know how to create those things because if it did, they wouldn’t need you. They would already be [[stamped out]] big time.

Almost everything that’s __in your house__, __in your workplace__, and __on the street__ used to be [[technology]] [[at one point in time]]. 
__There was a time when__ oil was a technology, that made J.D. Rockefeller rich. 
__There was a time when__ cars were technology, that made Henry Ford rich.

So, technology is just the set of things, ~~as Alan Kay said,~~ that don’t quite work yet [correction: Danny Hillis]. Once something works, it’s no longer technology. So, __society always wants new things__.

> Figure out what product you can provide and then figure out how to scale it

And if you want to be wealthy, you want to figure out which one of those things you can provide for society, that it does not yet know how to get, but it (society) will want, __that’s [[natural]] to you, and within your skillset, within your capabilities__.

And then you have to figure out how to scale it. Because if you just build one of it, that’s not enough. You’ve got to build thousands, or hundreds of thousands, or millions, or billions of them. So, everybody can have one.
