# Give Society What It Doesn’t Know How to Get

> Society will pay you for creating what it wants and delivering it at scale

> Give society what it wants, but doesn’t know how to get-at scale

Nivi: You’re not gonna get rich renting out your time. But you say that, “you will get rich by giving society what it wants, but does not yet know how to get [[at scale]].”

Naval: That’s right. So, essentially as we talked about before, money is `IOUs` from society saying, “You did something good in the past. Now here’s something that we owe you for the future.” And so society will __pay you for__ creating things that it wants.

But society doesn’t [[yet]] know how to create those things because if it did, they wouldn’t need you. They would already be [[stamped out]] big time.

Almost everything that’s __in your house__, __in your workplace__, and __on the street__ used to be [[technology]] [[at one point in time]]. 
__There was a time when__ oil was a technology, that made J.D. Rockefeller rich. 
__There was a time when__ cars were technology, that made Henry Ford rich.

So, technology is just the set of things, ~~as Alan Kay said,~~ that don’t quite work yet [correction: Danny Hillis]. Once something works, it’s no longer technology. So, __society always wants new things__.

> Figure out what product you can provide and then figure out how to scale it

And if you want to be wealthy, you want to figure out which one of those things you can provide for society, that it does not yet know how to get, but it (society) will want, __that’s [[natural]] to you, and within your skillset, within your capabilities__.

And then you have to figure out how to scale it. Because if you just build one of it, that’s not enough. You’ve got to build thousands, or hundreds of thousands, or millions, or billions of them. So, everybody can have one.

Steve Jobs, and his team of course figured out that society would want smartphones. A computer in their pocket that had all the phone capability times 100, and be easy to use. So, they figured out how to build that, and then they figured out how to scale it.

And they figured out how to get one into every __First World citizen’s pocket__, and eventually __every Third World citizen__ too. And so because of that they’re handsomely rewarded, and __Apple is the most valuable company in the world__.

Nivi: __The way I tried to [[put]] it__
was that the [[entrepreneur]]’s job is to try to bring __the [[high-end]]__ to __the [[mass]] market__.

Naval: It [[start as|starts as]] high end. First it starts as an act of creativity. 
First you create it __just because you want it__. 
You want it, and you know how to build it, and you need it. 
And so you __build it for yourself__. 
Then you figure out __how to get it to other people__. 
And then for a little while rich people have it.

Like, for example rich people had [[chauffeur]]s, and then they had black [[town car]]s. 
And then Uber [[came along]], and everyone’s __private driver__ is available to everybody. And now you can even see Uber [[pool]]s that are replacing [[shuttle bus]]es because it’s more convenient. 
And then you get [[scooter]]s, which are even [[further]] down market of that. 
So, you’re right. __It’s about distributing what rich people used to have to everybody.__

But the entrepreneur’s job starts [[even]] before that, which is creation. 
[[Entrepreneurship]] is __essentially__ an act of creating something new from scratch. 
Predicting that society will want it, 
and then figuring out how to scale it, 
and get it to everybody in a [[profitable]] way, in a [[self-sustaining]] way.
