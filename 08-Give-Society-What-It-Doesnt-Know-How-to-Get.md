# Give Society What It Doesn’t Know How to Get

> Society will pay you for creating what it wants and delivering it at scale

> Give society what it wants, but doesn’t know how to get-at scale

Nivi: You’re not gonna get rich renting out your time. But you say that, “you will get rich by giving society what it wants, but does not yet know how to get [[at scale]].”

Naval: That’s right. So, essentially as we talked about before, money is `IOUs` from society saying, “You did something good in the past. Now here’s something that we owe you for the future.” And so society will __pay you for__ creating things that it wants.

But society doesn’t [[yet]] know how to create those things because if it did, they wouldn’t need you. They would already be [[stamped out]] big time.

Almost everything that’s __in your house__, __in your workplace__, and __on the street__ used to be [[technology]] [[at one point in time]]. 
__There was a time when__ oil was a technology, that made J.D. Rockefeller rich. 
__There was a time when__ cars were technology, that made Henry Ford rich.
