> If you can do both, you will be [[unstoppable]]

Nivi: Talking about __combining skills__, you said that you should “learn to sell, learn to build, if you can do both, you will be [[unstoppable]].”

Naval: This is a very broad category. It’s two broad categories. One is building the product. 
Which is hard, and it’s [[multivariate]]. It can include design, it can include development, it can include [[manufacturing]], logistics, [[procurement]], it can even be __designing and operating a service__. 
__It has many, many definitions__.

But in every industry, there is a definition of the builder. 
In our tech industry it’s the CTO, it’s the programmer, it’s the software engineer, hardware engineer. 
But even in __the [[laundry]] business__, it could be the person who’s building the laundry service, who is making the trains run on time, who’s making sure all the clothes end up in the right place at the right time, and so on.

The other side of it is sales. Again, selling has a very broad definition. 
__Selling doesn’t necessarily just mean selling individual customers__, but it can mean marketing, it can mean communicating, it can mean recruiting, it can mean raising money, it can mean inspiring people, it could mean doing PR. It’s a broad [[umbrella]] category.

> The Silicon Valley model is a builder and seller

So, generally, the Silicon Valley startup model tends to work best. 
It’s not the only way, but it is probably the most common way, when you have two founders, one of whom __is world class at__ selling, and one of whom is world class at building.

Examples are, of course, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak with Apple, Gates and Allen probably had similar responsibilities early on with Microsoft, Larry and Sergey probably broke down along those lines, although it’s a little different there because that was a very technical product delivered to end users through a simple interface.

But generally, you will see this pattern repeated [[over and over]]. 
There’s a builder and there’s a seller. There’s a CEO and CTO [[combo]]. __And [[venture]] and technology investors are almost trained to look for this combo whenever possible.__ 
__It’s the magic combination.__

> If you can do both you will be unstoppable

[[The ultimate]] is __when one individual can do both__. That’s when you get true superpowers. That’s when you get people who can create entire industries.

__The living example__ is Elon Musk. 
He __may not necessarily be__ building the rockets himself, but he understands [[enough]] that he actually makes technical contributions. 
He understands the technology well enough that no one’s going to [[snow]] him on it, and he’s not running around __making claims that__ he doesn’t think he can’t eventually deliver. 
He may __be optimistic on__ the timelines but he thinks this is within [[reasonableness]] for delivery.

Even Steve Jobs developed enough product skills and __was involved enough in__ the product that he also operated in both of these domains. Larry Ellison started as a programmer and I think wrote the first version of Oracle, or __was actually heavily involved in__ it.

Marc Andreessen __was also in this domain__. He __may not have had enough confidence in__ his sales skills, but he was the programmer who wrote Netscape Navigator, or __a big chunk of__ it. 
So, I think the real [[giant]]s in any field are the people who can both build and sell.

> I’d rather teach an engineer marketing than a marketer engineering

And usually the building is a thing that a sales person can’t pick up later in life. __It requires too much [[focused time]].__ 
But a builder can pick up selling a little bit later, especially if they were already [[innately]] [[wired]] to be a good [[communicator]].
Bill Gates famously [[paraphrases]] this as, “I’d rather __teach__ an engineer marketing, than a marketer engineering.”

I think if you [[start out]] with a building [[mentality]] and you have building skills and it’s still early enough in your life, 
or you have enough [[focused time]] that you think you can learn selling, and you have some natural characteristics or you’re a good salesperson, then you can [[double down]] on those.

Now, your sales skills could be in a __different than__ traditional domain. For example, let’s say you’re a really good engineer and then people are saying, well, now you need to be good at sales, well, you may not be good at [[hand-to-hand]] sales, but you may be a really good writer.

And writing is a skill that can be learned much more easily than, say, [[in-person selling]], and so you may just [[cultivate]] writing skills until you become __a good online communicator__ and __then use that for your sales__.

On the other hand, it could just be that you’re a good builder and you’re bad at writing and __you don’t like communicating to mass audiences__ 
but you’re good [[one-on-one]], so then you might use your sales skills for __recruiting or for [[fundraising]]__, which are more one-on-one kinds of [[endeavors]].

__This is pointing out that__ if you’re at the intersection of these two, don’t [[despair]] because __you’re not going to be__ the best technologist and __you’re not going to be__ the best salesperson, 
but in a weird way, that combination, back to the Scott Adams skill stack, that combination of two skills is [[unstoppable]].

Long term, people who understand the underlying product and how to build it and can sell it, 
these are [[catnip]] to investors, 
these people can __break down walls__ if they have enough energy, and they can get almost anything done.
