> If you can do both, you will be [[unstoppable]]

Nivi: Talking about __combining skills__, you said that you should “learn to sell, learn to build, if you can do both, you will be [[unstoppable]].”

Naval: This is a very broad category. It’s two broad categories. One is building the product. 
Which is hard, and it’s [[multivariate]]. It can include design, it can include development, it can include [[manufacturing]], logistics, [[procurement]], it can even be __designing and operating a service__. 
__It has many, many definitions__.

But in every industry, there is a definition of the builder. 
In our tech industry it’s the CTO, it’s the programmer, it’s the software engineer, hardware engineer. 
But even in __the [[laundry]] business__, it could be the person who’s building the laundry service, who is making the trains run on time, who’s making sure all the clothes end up in the right place at the right time, and so on.

The other side of it is sales. Again, selling has a very broad definition. 
__Selling doesn’t necessarily just mean selling individual customers__, but it can mean marketing, it can mean communicating, it can mean recruiting, it can mean raising money, it can mean inspiring people, it could mean doing PR. It’s a broad [[umbrella]] category.

> The Silicon Valley model is a builder and seller

So, generally, the Silicon Valley startup model tends to work best. 
It’s not the only way, but it is probably the most common way, when you have two founders, one of whom __is world class at__ selling, and one of whom is world class at building.

Examples are, of course, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak with Apple, Gates and Allen probably had similar responsibilities early on with Microsoft, Larry and Sergey probably broke down along those lines, although it’s a little different there because that was a very technical product delivered to end users through a simple interface.

But generally, you will see this pattern repeated [[over and over]]. 
There’s a builder and there’s a seller. There’s a CEO and CTO [[combo]]. __And [[venture]] and technology investors are almost trained to look for this combo whenever possible.__ 
__It’s the magic combination.__
