> If you can do both, you will be [[unstoppable]]

Nivi: Talking about __combining skills__, you said that you should “learn to sell, learn to build, if you can do both, you will be [[unstoppable]].”

Naval: This is a very broad category. It’s two broad categories. One is building the product. 
Which is hard, and it’s [[multivariate]]. It can include design, it can include development, it can include [[manufacturing]], logistics, [[procurement]], it can even be __designing and operating a service__. 
__It has many, many definitions__.
