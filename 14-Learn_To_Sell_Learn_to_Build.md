> If you can do both, you will be [[unstoppable]]

Nivi: Talking about __combining skills__, you said that you should “learn to sell, learn to build, if you can do both, you will be [[unstoppable]].”

Naval: This is a very broad category. It’s two broad categories. One is building the product. 
Which is hard, and it’s [[multivariate]]. It can include design, it can include development, it can include [[manufacturing]], logistics, [[procurement]], it can even be __designing and operating a service__. 
__It has many, many definitions__.

But in every industry, there is a definition of the builder. 
In our tech industry it’s the CTO, it’s the programmer, it’s the software engineer, hardware engineer. 
But even in __the [[laundry]] business__, it could be the person who’s building the laundry service, who is making the trains run on time, who’s making sure all the clothes end up in the right place at the right time, and so on.
